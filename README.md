Assignment
Project Name: U.S Navy SEALS promote
This is a webpage providing a short brief about U.S. Navy SEALS for users that interested in the military aspect. The webpage provides short information about the formation, the qualification selection as a SEAL, the weapons that SEAL teams use and a gallery page.

Design Process:
At the first stage of design, I was thinking of making this page looks very stately as this is a military-related page. Thus, I decided to use pictures of Navy SEALS soldiers as the background so it does bring out the effect I expected. After that, I have research the colour that is related to navy so the webpage can have a suitable and consistent visual effect. Other than that, I also hope this webpage can help to inspire users to study and respect those heroes and warriors that willing to sacrifice themself to maintain the peace of the world.In the end, I created this webpage structure and wireframe that I think can fulfil my desire for inspiration.

Feature:
The feature that I used in this webpage is the navigation bar on the homepage. Users can easily jump to the page they are interested in by just clicking the button on top. Other than that, there is also a Navy SEALS' login simulation for users to input their user name and password. This allowed them to have more user-experienced with not only reading the information on this webpage.

Testing:
The testing was good as I only implemented a simple function on this webpage which is to link specific parts of the page to the navigation bar(button). This function works well as it does jump to the page once you click on the button.
